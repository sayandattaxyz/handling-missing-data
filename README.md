# handling-missing-data
One of the major problem that a Data Analyst/Scientist come accross is handeling missing datas. The main objective of this project is to apply various ways of handling missing data.

First we need to know what are the various ways we can handle missing data:
1) Complete case analysis: Removing the rows containing the missing value
2) Univariate: We apply different methods for numerical and categorical data
   2.a) Numerical Data: Mean/Median, Random, End of distribution
   2.b) Categorical Data: Mode, Missing
3) Multivariate: 
   3.a) KNN imputer
   3.b) Iterative imputer

In this project we will focuse mainly on removing rows and univariate methods. We will do a detailed statistical analysis and comparison of all the methods.
